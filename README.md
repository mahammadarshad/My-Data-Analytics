#### Water Potability Prediction Analysis
**Code:** [`water_potability_prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/mahammadarshad/My-Data-Analytics/blob/main/water_potability_prediction.ipynb)
<br>
**Description:** To build a predictive model that accurately determines whether water is potable (safe for human consumption) or not based on various water quality metrics.
The dataset contains several features representing different water quality metrics, such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity.
Each entry in the dataset is labeled as either potable (1) or not potable (0), indicating whether the water is safe for human consumption.
